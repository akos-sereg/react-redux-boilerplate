It generates a coverage report as well. You can set coverage expectations in ``config/jest.config.js``

## E2E Testing

Make sure that the application is running (`npm start`), and you are using `InMemory` backend (`app/services/ConfigService.ts`), as E2E tests
are running against your local instance.

Then run the following command

```
$ npm run cypress:open
```

For headless run (eg. on CI/CD, like Jenkins) you can execute `npm run cypress:run`
